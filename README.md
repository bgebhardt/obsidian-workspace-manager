# Workspaces Manager

I am building an Obsidian plugin to allow me to move and delete the open files between workspaces. Suggest how to write a plugin that will allow doing this in Obsidian in an UI will directly edit the .obsidian/workspaces.json

Here's how you could build a workspace reorganization UI that directly edits the workspaces.json file:

## Plugin Architecture

**Core Components:**
1. **Workspace Parser** - Read/write the workspaces.json file
2. **UI Modal** - Main interface for reorganization
3. **File Manager** - Handle file operations and validation
4. **Backup System** - Safety mechanism for rollbacks

## Implementation Approach

**Data Structure Management:**
```typescript
interface WorkspaceData {
  name: string;
  tabs: TabData[];
  layout: any; // Obsidian's layout structure
}

interface TabData {
  path: string;
  title: string;
  type: string; // 'markdown', 'canvas', etc.
}
```

**UI Design Options:**

**Option 1: Drag & Drop Interface**
- Left panel: List of all workspaces
- Right panel: Files in selected workspace
- Drag files between workspace panels
- Visual indicators for file types and states

Let's choose Option 1

**Option 2: Batch Transfer Interface**
- Dropdown to select source workspace
- Checklist of files in source workspace
- Dropdown to select destination workspace
- "Move Selected" button

**Option 3: Matrix View**
- Grid showing workspaces (columns) vs files (rows)
- Checkboxes at intersections
- Quick overview of which files are in which workspaces

For this implementation lets choose Option 1.

## Technical Implementation

**File Operations:**
```typescript
// Read current workspaces
const workspacesFile = this.app.vault.adapter.read('.obsidian/workspaces.json');

// Parse and modify
const workspaces = JSON.parse(workspacesFile);

// Update workspace structure
// Validate file paths still exist
// Write back to file
```

**Safety Features:**
- Automatic backup before any changes
- Validation that files still exist in vault
- Undo/redo functionality
- Preview mode before applying changes

**Integration Points:**
- Hook into Obsidian's workspace events
- Validate against current vault file structure
- Respect Obsidian's pane layout rules

## Development Path

1. **Start with a simple modal** that displays current workspace contents
2. **Add basic file moving** between workspaces
3. **Implement drag & drop** for better UX
4. **Add validation and safety features**
5. **Polish the UI** with better styling and feedback

Would you prefer to focus on any particular UI approach, or would you like me to elaborate on the technical implementation details for any of these components?

# Difference between between the workspace.json and workspaces.json
Obsidian uses two different workspace-related JSON files:

## workspace.json (singular)
- **Purpose**: Stores your **current** workspace state
- **Content**: The live layout, open files, pane arrangements, sidebar states
- **When updated**: Continuously as you work - opening files, moving panes, etc.
- **Location**: `.obsidian/workspace.json`
- **Think of it as**: Your "current session" that gets restored when you reopen Obsidian

## workspaces.json (plural) 
- **Purpose**: Stores your **saved** workspace configurations
- **Content**: Named workspace snapshots that you've deliberately saved
- **When updated**: Only when you manually save/delete/rename workspaces
- **Location**: `.obsidian/workspaces.json`
- **Think of it as**: Your "bookmarked workspace layouts"

## Key Differences

**workspace.json:**
```json
{
  "main": {
    "id": "abc123",
    "type": "split",
    "children": [...]
  },
  "left": {...},
  "right": {...}
}
```

**workspaces.json:**
```json
{
  "My Project A": {
    "main": {...},
    "left": {...}
  },
  "Research Mode": {
    "main": {...},
    "left": {...}
  }
}
```

## For Your Plugin

Your workspace reorganizer plugin should target **workspaces.json** (plural) because:
- That's where the named, saved workspaces live
- Users want to reorganize their saved workspace configurations
- The singular `workspace.json` is just the current state and gets overwritten constantly

The `workspace.json` gets updated automatically when you load a saved workspace from `workspaces.json`.
